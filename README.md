## Echo Engine is a fork of the Godot Engine

## 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

**[Echo Engine](https://Echoengine.org) is feature-packed, cross-platform
game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.** It provides a
comprehensive set of [common tools](https://Echoengine.org/features), so that
users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can
be exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop
platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as
Web-based platforms and [consoles](https://docs.Echoengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/platform/consoles.html).

## Free, open source and community-driven

Echo is completely free and open source under the very permissive [MIT license](https://godotengine.org/license).
No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down
to the last line of engine code. Echo's development is fully independent and
community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their
expectations. It is supported by the the open source community.
